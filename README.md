<hr>

## How to Use ü§î
1. First users get to choose their Robogotchi. By picking a robot, alien or human and choosing a name a character will be randomly generated for them. 

2. After choosing their 'gotchi they will then be asked to fill out an authentication form with name, email and password. 

3. Once account is created, user will be taken to a page with their health points and option to feed, entertain or exercise their 'gotchi. 

4. Overtime the hunger, boredom and laziness will grow as their health points decrease. When you feed, entertain or exercise your 'gotchi their overall health will increase as their hunger, boredom and laziness goes back down. 

After searching for a band or musician the user is provided with a short biography, images, social media links and even music videos.

 
They can also search by artist or location to find relevant concerts.

## How it Works üî®
The application uses two seperate API's to retrieve data.
1. TheAudioDB API <br>
*A community Database of audio artwork and data*
```
router.get("/search", (req, res) => {
    const artistName = req.query.artistName.replace(/\s/g, "+");
    let artistData;
    axios.get(`https://www.theaudiodb.com/api/v1/json/${apiKey}/search.php?s=${artistName}`)
        .then(results => results.data.artists.map(result => {
            // === create artist object with original api call data
            let artist = {
                artistId: result.idArtist,
                artistName: result.strArtist,
                label: result.strLabel,
                genre: result.strGenre,
                website: "http://" + result.strWebsite, // concat http:// for link compatability
                facebook: "http://" + result.strFacebook, // concat http:// for link compatability
                twitter: "http://" + result.strTwitter, // concat http:// for link compatability
                biography: result.strBiographyEN,
                country: result.strCountry ,
                artistThumb: result.strArtistThumb ,
                artistLogo: result.strArtistLogo,
                artistFanart: result.strArtistFanart,
                artistFanart2: result.strArtistFanart2,
                artistFanart3: result.strArtistFanart3
            }
            artistData = artist;
            return artistData;
        }))
```

2. SongKick API <br>
*Gives easy access to the biggest live music database in the world*
```
router.get("/search" , (req, res) => {
    const artistName = req.query.artistName.replace(/\s/g, "+");
    axios.get(`https://api.songkick.com/api/3.0/events.json?artist_name=${artistName}&per_page=10&apikey=${apiKey}`)
        .then(results => songkickParse(results))
        .then(mappedResults => res.json(mappedResults))
        .catch(err => res.status(422).json(err));
});
```

## Functionality üí™
#### Here's how the app works: 


## Getting Started üèÅ

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for grading and testing purposes. 

1. Clone repository. Click on the clone button next to the repository (clone with SSH). 
2. Open Terminal and git clone (paste) into directory of your choice. 
3. Open folder in VS Code. 
4. The `config` folder holds each of the database objects, one for the deployed app, one for testing and one for JAWSDB which is necessary for the heroku connection. Also contains `middleware` and `passport.js`file which holds the authentication logic.
5. Inside of the `models` folder is the `gotchi.js` with the intial table data, and the `index.js` which connects to the database using sequelize. 
6. The `schema.sql` holds the timers needed for automatically updating the MYSQL table by incrementing the health of the 'gotchis. 
7. The `apiRoutes.js` holds validation logic and connects to the database where the `htmlRoutes.js` sends information from the database to the front end of the application. 
8. `public` holds the assets, css, images and the javascript connecting to the html
9. The `views` folder has all of handlebars files, which replaces html and displays the information to the user. 
10. `server.js` connects the app to the server and the correct port.

## Pre-Requisites ‚úîÔ∏è
